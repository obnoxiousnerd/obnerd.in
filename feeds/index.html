<h3 id="what-are-feeds">What are feeds?</h3>
<p>As explained by the excellent <a href="https://aboutfeeds.com/">About Feeds</a>,
a feed is a way to subscribe to a website for content. Its similar to
"following" some one on a social media platform.</p>
<p>These feeds are consumed by feed readers, which can run locally on your machine,
or can be hosted somewhere else, which then can be accessed from any device
capable of accessing the internet.</p>
