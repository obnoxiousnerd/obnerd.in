title: About Notes
---

Notes are a sort of micro-blog for me. I aim to POSSE these to related websites
if that is possible. You can expect longer replies to posts I find online, or
replies containing stuff which I could consider to be necessary to be archived.

Indivivual notes's file names are in the format `%Y-%V-nn.md`, where
`%Y` = full year, `%V` = ISO week number, `nn` = nth post for said week.

There should also be a webmention reply below.
