            <p>Notes are a sort of micro-blog for me. I aim to POSSE these to related websites
if that is possible. You can expect longer replies to posts I find online, or
replies containing stuff which I could consider to be necessary to be archived.</p>
<p>Indivivual notes's file names are in the format <code>%Y-%V-nn.md</code>, where
<code>%Y</code> = full year, <code>%V</code> = ISO week number, <code>nn</code> = nth post for said week.</p>
<p>There should also be a webmention reply below.</p>
